Abstract
Social networks with positive and negative links often split into two antagonistic factions. Examples of such a split abound:
revolutionaries versus an old regime, Republicans versus Democrats, Axis versus Allies during the second world war, or the
Western versus the Eastern bloc during the Cold War. Although this structure, known as social balance, is well understood, it
is not clear how such factions emerge. An earlier model could explain the formation of such factions if reputations were
assumed to be symmetric. We show this is not the case for non-symmetric reputations, and propose an alternative model
which (almost) always leads to social balance, thereby explaining the tendency of social networks to split into two factions.
In addition, the alternative model may lead to cooperation when faced with defectors, contrary to the earlier model. The
difference between the two models may be understood in terms of the underlying gossiping mechanism: whereas the
earlier model assumed that an individual adjusts his opinion about somebody by gossiping about that person with
everybody in the network, we assume instead that the individual gossips with that person about everybody. It turns out
that the alternative model is able to lead to cooperative behaviour, unlike the previous model.

propose a second model that is based on a different underlying
gossiping mechanism, and show that it generically does lead to
social balance, even when reputations are not symmetric.
Moreover, there is a natural connection between negative links
and the evolution of cooperation: we consider positive links as
indicating cooperation and negative links as defection. We will
show that our alternative model is able to lead to cooperation,
whereas the earlier model cannot.

Introduction
Why do two antagonistic factions emerge so frequently in social
networks? This question was already looming in the 1940s, when
Heider [1] examined triads of individuals in networks, and
postulated that only balanced triads are stable. A triad is balanced
when friends agree in their opinion of a third party, while foes
disagree, see Fig. 1. The individuals in an unbalanced triad have
an incentive to adjust their opinions so as to reduce the stress
experienced in such a situation [2]. Once an adjustment is made,
the triad becomes balanced, and the stress disappears.
A decade later, Harary [3] showed that a complete social
network splits in at most two factions if and only if all its triads are
balanced, see also [4]. Such networks are called (socially) balanced
as well. Since then, the focus of much of the research has been on
detecting such factions in signed networks [5,6]. Many signed
networks show evidence of social balance, although the split into
factions might not be exact, that is, they are only nearly socially
balanced [7–10].
What has been lacking until fairly recently, are dynamical
models that explain how social balance emerges. The purpose of
this paper is to analyse two such models. One of these models,
proposed first in [11], was proved to exhibit social balance in [12].
However, this was done under a restrictive symmetry assumption
for the reputation matrix. Here, we continue the analysis of this
model and show that it generically does not lead to social balance
when the symmetry assumption is dropped. In contrast, we

Earlier Model
Certain discrete-time, stochastic dynamics have been investigated [13,14], but they exhibit so-called jammed states [15]: no
change in the sign of a reputation improves the degree of social
balance, as measured by the total number of balanced triads in the
network. A surprisingly simple continuous-time model [11] was
proved to converge to social balance for certain symmetric initial
conditions [12]. The authors assume that the social network is
described by a complete graph (everybody is connected to
everybody), with weighted links representing reputations that
change continuously in time. Let X denote the real-valued matrix
of the reputations, so that Xij represents the opinion i has about j. It
is positive whenever i considers j a friend, and negative if i thinks of
j as an enemy. The network is balanced, if, up to a possible
relabelling of the individuals, the sign structure of X takes one of
two possible block forms:

Changes in the reputations are modelled as follows:

Assuming that u1 has no zero entries, and up to a suitable
permutation of its components, the latter limit takes one of the
forms in Eq. 1. In other words, if the initial reputation matrix is
symmetric and has a simple, positive eigenvalue, then the
normalized reputation matrix becomes balanced in finite time.
Our first main result is that this conclusion remains valid for
normal initial conditions, i.e. for initial conditions that satisfy the
equality X(0)XT (0) = XT (0)X(0), see SI Text S1, Theorem 2.
Whereas the real eigenvalues behave similar to the symmetric
case, the complex eigenvalues show circular behaviour, which
results in small ‘‘bumps’’ in the dynamics as shown in Fig. 2 (see SI
Fig. S1 for more detail). More precisely, if X(0) is normal and if
l1(0) is a real, positive and simple eigenvalue which is larger than
every other real eigenvalue (if any), then the solution X(t) of Eq. 2
satisfies Eq. 4. Hence, once again, the normalized reputation
matrix converges to a balanced state.
Our second main result is that this conclusion does not carry
over to the case where X(0) is not normal, see SI Text S1,
Theorem 3. This general case is analysed by first transforming
X(0) into its real Jordan-canonical form J(0): X(0) = TJ(0)T–1,
where T consists of a basis of (the real and imaginary parts of)
generalized eigenvectors of X(0). It can then be shown that the
solution X(t) of Eq. 2 is given by TJ(t)T–1, where J(t) solves the
matrix equation J_ ~J 2 , an equation which can still be solved
explicitly. Hence, X(t) can still be determined. It turns out that if
X(0) has a real, positive and simple eigenvalue l1(0) which is
larger than every other real eigenvalue (if any), then the
normalized reputation matrix satisfies:

factions, if and only if all triads are balanced. This is represented by the

where X_ denotes the derivative with respect to time of the matrix
X. The idea behind this model is that reputations are adjusted
based on the outcome of a particular gossiping process. More
specifically, suppose that Bob (individual i) wants to revise his
opinion about John (individual j). Bob then asks everybody else in
the network what they think of John. If one such opinion Xkj has
the same sign as the opinion Bob has about his gossiping partner,
i.e. as Xik, then Bob will increase his opinion about John. But if
these opinions differ in sign, then Bob will decrease his opinion
about John.
The analysis for symmetric initial conditions X(0) = XT (0) was
carried out in [12]: First, X(0) is diagonalized by an orthogonal
transformation X(0) = UL(0)UT, where the columns of U are
orthonormal eigenvectors u1,…,un of X(0) so that UUT = In, and
L(0) is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the
corresponding real eigenvalues l1(0) $ l2(0)$ ? $ ln(0) of X(0).
Direct substitution of the matrix function UL(t)UT shows that it
is the solution of Eq. 2 with initial condition X(0). Here, L(t) is
a diagonal matrix, solving the uncoupled matrix equation
: L~L2 with initial condition L(0). The diagonal entries of L(t)
are obtained by integrating the scalar first order equations

where u1 and vT1 are left and right eigenvectors of X(0)
respectively, that correspond to the eigenvalue l1(0). If we
assume that none of the entries of u1 and v1 are zero, then we
can always find a suitable permutation of the components of u1
and v1 such that they have the following sign structure:

Hence, the solution X(t) blows up in finite time if and only if

and obtain

Alternative Model
Let us briefly reconsider the gossiping process underlying model
X_ ~X 2 . In our example of Bob and John, the following happens.
Bob asks others what they think of John. Bob takes into account
what he thinks of the people he talks to, and adjusts his opinion of
John accordingly. An alternative approach is to consider a type of
homophily process [16–18]: people tend to befriend people who
think alike. When Bob seeks to revise his opinion of John, he talks
to John about everybody else (instead of talking to everybody else
about John). For example, suppose that Bob likes Alice, but that
John dislikes her. When Bob and John talk about Alice, they notice
they have opposing views about her, and as a result the
relationship between Bob and John deteriorates. On the other
hand, should they share similar opinions about Alice, their
relationship will improve. Thus, our alternative model for the
update law of the reputations is:
X_ ~XX T , or X_ ij ~

Z_ ~Z 2 zA0 AT0 :

The latter matrix Riccati differential equation can be integrated, yielding the solution Z(t) explicitly, and hence S(t), as well as
X(t), can be calculated.
It turns out that if A0 ? 0, then X(t) always blows up in finite
time. Moreover, using a perturbation argument, it can be shown
there is a dense set of initial conditions X(0) such that the
normalized solution of Eq. 6 converges to

for some vector w, as t approaches the blow-up time t*, see SI Text
S1, Theorem 5. If w has no zero entries, this implies that the
normalized solution becomes balanced in finite time. Hence, the
alternative model in Eq. 6 generically evolves to social balance, see
Fig. 2.

Although there apparently is only a subtle difference in the
gossiping processes underlying the models in Eq. 2 and 6, these
models turn out to behave quite differently, as we discuss next.
Our third main result is that for generic initial conditions, the
normalized solution of system Eq. 6 converges to a socially
balanced state in finite time. To show this, we decompose the
solution X(t) into its symmetric and skew-symmetric parts:
T
X(t) = S(t)+ A(t), where S(t) = ST(t) and A(t) = –AT (t). Since X_ ~X_ ,
the skew-symmetric part remains constant, and therefore
A(t) = A(0) ; A0. The symmetric part then obeys the matrix

Evolution of Cooperation
Positive and negative links have a natural interpretation in the
light of cooperation: positive links indicate cooperation and
negative links indicate defection. There is then also a natural
motivation for the alternative model in terms of cooperation.
Again, suppose Bob wants to revise his opinion of John. For Bob it
is important to know whether John is cooperative in order to
determine whether he should cooperate with John or not. So,
instead of asking Alice whether she has cooperated with John, Bob
would like to know whether John has cooperated with her. In
other words, Bob is not interested in Xkj but in Xjk, consistent with

Dynamical Models Explaining Social Balance

Eq. 6, illustrated in Fig. 2. This is also what is observed in studies
on gossip: it often concerns what others did, not what one thinks of
others [19,20].
Indeed gossiping seems crucial in explaining the evolution of
human cooperation through indirect reciprocity [21]. It has even
been suggested that humans developed larger brains in order to
gossip, so as to control the problem of cooperation through social
interaction [22]. In general, the problem is that if defection allows
individuals to gain more, why then do individuals cooperate? This
is usually modelled in the form of a prisoner’s dilemma, in which
each agent has the possibility to give his partner some benefit b at
some cost c,b. So, if an agent’s partner cooperates (he gives the
agent b) but the agent doesn’t cooperate (he doesn’t pay the cost c)
his total payoff will be b. Considering the other possibilities results
in the payoff matrix detailed in Fig. 3.
Irrespective of the choice of the other player, it is better to defect
in a single game. Suppose that the second player cooperates. Then
if the first player cooperates he gains b – c, while if he defects he
gains b, so defecting is preferable. Now suppose that the second
player defects. The first player then has to pay c, but doesn’t have
to pay anything when defecting. So indeed, in a single game, it is
always better to defect, yet the payoff is higher if both cooperate,
whence the dilemma.
In reality, we do observe cooperation, and various mechanisms
for explaining the evolution of cooperation have been suggested
[23], such as kin selection [24,25], reciprocity [26] or group
selection [27]. Humans have a tendency however to also cooperate
in contexts beyond kin, group or repeated interactions. It is
believed that some form of indirect reciprocity can explain the
breadth of human cooperation [21]. Whereas in direct reciprocity
the favour is returned by the interaction partner, in indirect
reciprocity the favour is returned by somebody else, which usually
involves some reputation. It has been theorized that such a
mechanism could even form the basis of morality [28]. Additionally, reputation (and the fear of losing reputation) seems to play an
important role in maintaining social norms [29–31].
In general, the idea is the following: agents obtain some good
reputation by helping others, and others help those with a good
reputation. Initially a strategy known as image scoring was
introduced [32]. Shortly after, it was argued that a different
strategy, known as the standing strategy, should actually perform
better [33], although experiments showed people tend to prefer
the simpler image scoring strategy [34]. This led to more
systematic studies of how different reputation schemes would
perform [35–37]. Although much research has been done on
indirect reciprocity, only few theoretical works actually study how
gossiping shapes reputations [38,39]. Nonetheless, most studies

(tacitly) assume that reputations are shaped through gossip.
Additionally, it was observed experimentally that gossiping is an
effective mechanism for promoting cooperation [40–42].
Moreover, these reputations are usually considered as objective.
That is, all agents know the reputation Xj of some agent j, and all
agents have the same view of agent j. Private reputations–so that
we have Xij, the reputation of j in the eyes of i–have usually been
considered by allowing a part of the population to ‘‘observe’’ an
interaction, and update the reputation accordingly. If too few
agents are allowed to ‘‘observe’’ an interaction, the reputations Xij
tend to become uncorrelated and incoherent. This makes
reputation unreliable for deciding whether to cooperate or defect.
The central question thus becomes how to model private
reputations such that they remain coherent and reliable for
deciding whether to cooperate or not.
Dynamical models of social balance might provide an answer to
this question. Although it allows to have private reputations–that is
Xij–the dynamics could also lead to some coherence in the form of
social balance. In addition, it models more explicitly the gossiping
process, commonly suggested to be the foundation upon which
reputations are forged.

Simulation Results
The reputations of the agents are determined by the dynamics
of the two models. We call agents using X_ ~X 2 dynamics type A,
and those using X_ ~XX T dynamics type B. We assume that agent
i cooperates with j whenever Xij .0 and defects otherwise. Agents
reproduce proportional to their fitness, determined by their payoff.
Agents that do well (have a high payoff) have a higher chance of
reproduction, and we are interested in knowing the probability
that a certain type becomes fixated in the population (i.e. takes
over the whole population), known as the fixation probability r.
All simulations start off with an equal amount of agents, so if some
type wins more often than his initial relative frequency, it indicates
it has an evolutionary advantage. For the results presented here
this comes down to r .1/2. More details on the simulations are
provided in the Materials and Methods section at the end of the
paper.
The results are displayed in Fig. 4 using a normalized cost of c
= 1 (the ratio b/c drives the evolutionary dynamics, see Materials
and Methods and [23]). When directly competing against each
other, type B has an evolutionary advantage (its fixation
probability rB .1/2) compared to type A, already for relatively
small benefits. When each type is playing against defectors (agents
that always defect), type A seems unable to defeat defectors (rA
,1/2) for any b ,20, while type B performs quite well against
them. When all three types are playing against each other results
are similar (see SI Fig. S2). When varying the number of agents,
the critical benefit b* at which type B starts to have an evolutionary
advantage changes (i.e. where the fixation probability rB = 1/2).
For b.b* agents using the model X_ ~XX T have a higher chance
to become fixated, while for b,b* defectors tend to win. The
inequality for type B to have an evolutionary advantage can be
pﬃﬃﬃ
relatively accurately approximated by bwb  ~c n where c is
estimated to be around c < 1.7260.037 (95% confidence
interval). Varying the intensity of selection does not alter the
results qualitatively (see SI Fig. S3). Summarizing, type B is able to
lead to cooperation and defeats type A. Based on these results, if a
gossiping process evolved during the course of human history in
order to maintain cooperation, the model X_ ~XX T seems more
likely to have evolved than X_ ~X 2 . For smaller groups a smaller
benefit is needed for the model X_ ~XX T to become fixated. This

Conclusion

Materials and Methods

To conclude, we have shown that the alternative model
X_ ~XX T generically converges to social balance, whereas the
model X_ ~X 2 did not. The current models exhibit several
unrealistic features, we would like to address: (1) an all-to-all
topology; (2) dynamics that blow-up in finite time; and (3)
homogeneity of all agents. Although most of these issues can be
addressed by specifying different dynamics, the resulting models
are much more difficult to analyse, thereby limiting our
understanding. Although the two models are somewhat simple,
they are also tractable, and what we lose in truthfulness, we gain in
deeper insights: in simplicity lies progress. Our current analysis
offers a quite complete understanding, and we hope it provides a
stepping stone to more realistic models, which we would like to
analyse in the future.
The difference between the two models can be understood in
terms of gossiping: we assume that people who wish to revise their
opinion about someone talk to that person about everybody else,
while the earlier model assumed that people talk about that person
to everybody else. Both gossiping and social balance are at the
centre of many social phenomena [22,29,43,44], such as norm
maintenance [30], stereotype formation [45] and social conflict
[46]. For example, a classic work [29] on the established and
outsiders found that gossiping was the fundamental driving force
for the maintenance of the cohesive network of the established at
the exclusion of the outsiders. Understanding how social balance
may emerge might help to understand the intricacies of these
social phenomena.
Moreover, in light of the evolution of cooperation it appears
that agents using X_ ~XX T dynamics perform well against
defectors, and have an evolutionary advantage compared to
agents using X_ ~X 2 dynamics. Contrary to other models of
indirect reciprocity, not everybody might end up cooperating with
everybody, and the population may split into two groups. This
provides an interesting connection between social balance theory,
gossiping and the evolution of cooperation. Our results improve
our understanding of gossiping as a mechanism for group

In the simulations of the evolution of cooperation, the dynamics
consist of two parts: (1) the interaction dynamics within each
generation; and (2) the dynamics prescribing how the population
evolves from generation to generation.

Interaction Dynamics
We include three possible types of agents in our simulations:
Type A uses X_ ~X 2 dynamics,
Type B uses X_ ~XX T dynamics, and
Defectors have trivial reputation dynamics X_ ~0, with
negative constant reputations.
We can decompose the reputation matrix X(t) accordingly into
three parts:
0

1
X A ðt Þ
B
C
X ðtÞ~@ XB ðtÞ A,
X D ðt Þ
where XA(t) are the reputations of all agents in the eyes of agents of
type A, XB(t) for type B and XD(t) for defectors. The reputations
XA(0) and XB(0) are initialized from a standard Gaussian
distribution. The initial reputation for XD(0) will be set to a fixed
negative value. To be clear, XD(0) is the reputation of all other
agents in the eyes of defectors, which is negative initially. The
initial reputation of the defectors themselves is of course not
necessarily negative initially. For the results displayed here we
have used XD(0) = 210, but results remain by and large the same
when varying this parameter, as long as it remains sufficiently
negative.
Since we are dealing with continuous dynamics in this paper, we
assume all agents are involved in infinitesimally short games at
each time instance t. Each agent i may choose to either cooperate
or defect with another agent j, and this decision may vary from one
agent to the next. For agents of type A and type B the decision to

This evolutionary mechanism can be seen as a Wright-Fisher
process [47] with fitnesses ebPi ðgÞ . It is well known that this process
converges faster than a Moran birth-death process, since it
essentially takes n time steps in a Moran process to reproduce the
effect of one time step in a Wright-Fisher process [47]. Because of
the high computational costs (solving repeatedly a non-linear
system of differential equations of size n2), this process is
preferable.
Higher b signifies higher selective pressure, and leads to a
higher reproduction of those with a high payoff, and in the case
that b R ‘ only those with the maximum payoff reproduce. On

= 0.5 for the low selective pressure, b = 5 for the high selective
pressure, reported in SI Fig. S3. For the results in the main text we
have used b = 1.
For an evolutionary neutral selection in where all Pi(g) = P are
effectively the same, b has no effect, and wi = 1/n. Notice that if
we rescale Pi(g) by 1/c so that the payoff effectively becomes

Defectors will simply always defect. Whenever an agent i
cooperates with j the latter receives a payoff of b at a cost of c to
agent i. We integrate this payoff over all infinitesimally short
games from time 0 to time t*, which can be represented as

Evolutionary Dynamics
We have simulated the evolution of cooperation for n

We consider four different schemes for initializing the first

and we rescale b by c, then the reproduction probabilities remain
unchanged. Hence, only the ratio b/c effectively plays a role up to
a rescaling of the intensity of selection. Since the point at which the
evolution is neutral (i.e. r equals the initial proportional
frequency), is independent of b, this point will only depend on
the ratio b/c. So, we normalized the cost c = 1. To verify this, we
also ran additional simulations with different costs, which indeed
gave the same results.
We stop the simulation whenever one of the types becomes
fixated in the population. With fixation we mean that all other types
have gone extinct, and only a single type remains. If no type has
become fixated after 1,000 generations, we terminate the
simulation and count as winner the most frequent type. This
almost never happens, and the simulation usually stops after a
relatively small number of generations.
In total, we repeat this process 1,000 times for the results in the
main text, and for the low (b = 0.5) and high (b = 5) selective
pressure 100 times. This means that we run the evolutionary
dynamics until one of the types has become fixated, and we record
which type has ‘‘won’’. After that, we again start from the first
generation, and run until fixation, and repeat this. Finally, we
calculate how many rounds a type has ‘‘won’’ compared to the
total number of rounds, which yields the fixation probability r.

Here pA(0),pB(0) and pD(0) are respectively the proportion of
agents of type A, type B and defectors in the first generation. We
use the vector Ti(g) M {A, B, D} to denote the type of agent i in
generation g, so that Ti(g) = A if agent i is a type A player, Ti(g) = B
for a type B player, and Ti(g) = D for a defector. We are interested
in estimating the probability that a single type takes over the whole
population, known as the fixation probability rA, rB and rD for the
three different types. If a type has no evolutionary advantage, it is
said to be evolutionary neutral, and in that case its fixation
probability is equal to its initial frequency, e.g. for type A
rA = pA(0).
We will keep the population constant at the initial n, and simply
choose n new agents according to their payoff for the next
generation. This can be thought of as choosing n times one of the n
agents in the old generation for reproduction. Let wi denote the
probability that an agent is selected for reproduction, which we
define as

Since we are only interested in the number of agents of a certain
type, we can also gather all payoffs for the same type of agents, and
write
