ABSTRACT As speech recognition moves toward more unconstrained domains such as conversational speech, we encounter a need to be able to segment (or resegment) waveforms and recognizer output into linguistically meaningful units, such a sentences. Toward this end, we present a simple automatic segmenter of transcripts based on N-gram language modeling. We also study the relevance of several word-level features for segmentation performance. Using only word-level information, we achieve 85% recall and 70% precision on linguistic boundary detection.  1.  

l introduction est : 1. INTRODUCTION Today’s large-vocabulary speechrecognizers typically prefer to pro- cess a few tens of seconds of speech at a time, to keep the time and memory demands of the decoder within bounds. For longer inputs, the waveform is usually presegmented into shorter pieces based on simple acoustic criteria, such as nonspeech intervals (e.g., pauses) and turn boundaries (when several speakers are involved). We refer to such segmentations as acoustic segmentations. Acoustic segmentations generally do not reflect the linguistic struc- ture of utterances. They may fragment sentences or semantic units, or group together spans of unrelated units. We examine several rea- sons why such behavior is undesirable, and propose that linguistic segmentations be used instead. This requires algorithms for auto- matically finding linguistic units. In this paper we report on first results from our ongoing efforts toward such an automatic linguis- tic segmentation. In all further discussion, unless otherwise noted, the terms ‘segment,’ ‘segmentation,’ etc. will refer to linguistic seg- mentations.
